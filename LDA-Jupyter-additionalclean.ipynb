resource-dependent livelihoodsbackground: every day billions of people - especially those living in poverty - are exposed to infectious pathogens in the environment and are at risk of contracting 'environmentally mediated' infections: those with environmental reservoirs that affect disease persistence and control the complex ecology of environmental pathogens creates a global health problem not easily solved with medical treatment alonemethods: here we quantified the global disease burden caused by environmentally mediated infections and used a structural equation modeling approach to explore correlated factors at the global scalefindings: we found that 80% of pathogen species known to infect humans are environmentally mediated causing about 40% of today's burden of infectious disease (global loss of 130 million years of healthy life annually) more than 91% of environmentally mediated burden occurs in tropical countries and the poorest countries carry the highest burdens across all latitudes we found weak or absent effects of biodiversity or agricultural land use at the global scale in contrast the strongest proximate indicator of environmentally mediated infectious disease burden is rural poor livelihoods political stability and wealth are associated with improved sanitation better health care and lower proportions of rural poor people indirectly resulting in lower burdens of environmentally mediated infections interpretation: the high and uneven burden of environmentally mediated infections highlights the need for innovative social and ecological interventions to complement biomedical advances in the pursuit of global health and sustainability goalschanges in precipitation patterns might have deleterious effects on population health we used data from the uganda national panel survey from 2009 to 2012 (n = 3223 children contributing 5013 assessments) to evaluate the link between rainfall and undernutrition in children under age 5 years we considered 3 outcomes (underweight wasting and stunting) and measured precipitation using household-reported drought and deviations from long-term precipitation trends measured by satellite we specified multilevel logistic regression models with random effects for the community village and individual underweight (13%) wasting (4%) and stunting (33%) were common reported drought was associated with underweight (marginal risk ratio (rr) = 118 95% confidence interval (ci): 104 135) in adjusted analyses positive annual deviations (greater rainfall) from long-term precipitation trends were protective against underweight (marginal rr per 50-mm increase = 094 95% ci: 092 097) and wasting (marginal rr per 50-mm increase = 093 95% ci: 087 098) but not stunting (marginal rr per 50-mm increase = 100 95% ci: 098 101) precipitation was associated with measures of acute but not chronic malnutrition using both objective and subjective measures of exposure sudden reductions in

       " (\"automated annotation of protein function is challenging as the number of sequenced genomes rapidly grows the overwhelming majority of protein products can only be annotated computationally if computational predictions are to be relied upon it is crucial that the accuracy of these methods be high here we report the results from the first large-scale community-based critical assessment of protein function annotation (cafa) experiment fifty-four methods representing the state of the art for protein function prediction were evaluated on a target set of 866 proteins from 11 organisms two findings stand out: (i) today's best protein function prediction algorithms substantially outperform widely used first-generation methods with large gains on all types of targets; and (ii) although the top methods perform well enough to guide experiments there is considerable need for improvement of currently available toolsbackground:a major bottleneck in our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of life is the assignment of function to proteins while molecular experiments provide the most reliable annotation of proteins their relatively low throughput and restricted purview have led to an increasing role for computational function prediction however assessing methods for protein function prediction and tracking progress in the field remain challenging results: we conducted the second critical assessment of functional annotation (cafa) a timed challenge to assess computational methods that automatically assign protein function we evaluated 126 methods from 56 research groups for their ability to predict biological functions using gene ontology and gene-disease associations using human phenotype ontology on a set of 3681 proteins from 18 species cafa2 featured expanded analysis compared with cafa1 with regards to data set size variety and assessment metrics to review progress in the field the analysis compared the best methods from cafa1 to those of cafa2 conclusions: the top-performing methods in cafa2 outperformed those from cafa1 this increased accuracy can be attributed to a combination of the growing number of experimental annotations and improved methods for function prediction the assessment also revealed that the definition of top-performing algorithms is ontology specific that different performance metrics can be used to probe the nature of accurate predictions and the relative diversity of predictions in the biological process and human phenotype ontologies while there was methodological improvement between cafa1 and cafa2 the interpretation of results and usefulness of individual methods remain context-dependentbackground: we introduce the linguistic annotation of a corpus of 97 full-text biomedical publications known as the colorado richly annotated full text (craft) corpus we further assess the performance of existing tools for performing sentence splitting tokenization syntactic parsing and named entity recognition on this corpus results: many biomedical natural language processing systems demonstrated large differences between their previously published results and their performance on the craft corpus when tested with the publicly available models or rule sets trainable systems differed widely with respect to their ability to build high-performing models based on this data conclusions: the finding that some systems were able to train high-performing models based on this corpus is additional evidence beyond high inter-annotator agreement that the quality of the craft corpus is high the overall poor performance of various systems indicates that considerable work needs to be done to enable natural language processing systems to work well when the input is full-text journal articles the craft corpus provides a valuable resource to the biomedical natural language processing community for evaluation and training of new models for biomedical full text publicationsthe colorado richly annotated full text (craft) corpus consists of full-text journal articles the primary motivation for the annotation project was the accumulating body of evidence indicating that the bodies of journal articles contain much information that is not present in the abstracts and that the textual and structural characteristics of article bodies are different from those of abstracts the development of craft was characterized by a äóìmulti-modeläó\\x9d annotation task the sample population was all journal articles that had been used by the mouse genome informatics group as evidence for at least one gene ontology or mouse phenotype ontology äóìannotationäó\\x9d the linguistic annotation is represented in the widely known penn treebank format (marcus et al comput linguist 19(2) 313äóñ330 1993) [50] with the addition of a small number of tags and phrasal categories to accommodate the idiosyncrasies of the domainbackground:gene ontology (go) terms represent the standard for annotation and representation of molecular functions biological processes and cellular compartments but a large gap exists between the way concepts are represented in the ontology and how they are expressed in natural language text the construction of highly specific go terms is formulaic consisting of parts and pieces from more simple terms results: we present two different types of manually generated rules to help capture the variation of how go terms can appear in natural language text the first set of rules takes into account the compositional nature of go and recursively decomposes the terms into their smallest constituent parts the second set of rules generates derivational variations of these smaller terms and compositionally combines all generated variants to form the original term by applying both types of rules new synonyms are generated for two-thirds of all go terms and an increase in f-measure performance for recognition of go on the craft corpus from 0498 to 0636 is observed additionally we evaluated the combination of both types of rules over one million full text documents from elsevier; manual validation and error analysis show we are able to recognize go concepts with reasonable accuracy (88 %) based on random sampling of annotations conclusions: in this work we present a set of simple synonym generation rules that utilize the highly compositional and formulaic nature of the gene ontology concepts we illustrate how the generated synonyms aid in improving recognition of go concepts on two different biomedical corpora we discuss other applications of our rules for go ontology quality assurance explore the issue of overgeneration and provide examples of how similar methodologies could be applied to other biomedical terminologies additionally we provide all generated synonyms for use by the text-mining communitybackground:a major bottleneck in our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of life is the assignment of function to proteins while

network and all published estimates of stage-specific infectivity we use dynamic exponential random graph models to estimate partnership network parameters from an empirical study of sexual behavior and drive a stochastic simulation of hiv transmission through this dynamic network our simulated networks match observed frequencies and durations of short- and long-term partnerships with concurrency patterns specific to gender and partnership type our findings suggest that at current behavior levels the epidemic cannot be sustained in this population without both concurrency and acute infection; removing either brings transmission below the threshold for persistence with both present we estimate 20äóñ25% of transmissions stem from acute-stage infections 30äóñ50% from chronic-stage and 30äóñ45% from aids-stage the impact of acute infection is strongly moderated by concurrency reducing this impact by reducing concurrency could potentially end the current hiv epidemic in zimbabwethe federated states of micronesia (fsm) has received considerable attention for their alarming rates of overweight and obesity on kosrae one of the four districts in the fsm 88% of adults aged 20 or older are overweight (bmi > 25) 59% are obese (bmi > 30) and 24% are extremely obese (bmi > 35) recent genetic studies in kosrae have shown that obesity is a highly heritable trait and more work is underway to identify obesity genes in humans however less attention has been given to potential social and developmental causes of obesity in the fsm this paper outlines the long history of foreign rule and social change over the last 100 years and suggests that a combination of dietary change influenced by foreigners dependence on foreign aid and the ease of global food trade contributed to poor diet and increased rates of obesity in micronesia the last section of the paper highlights the pacific tuna trade as an example of how foreign dependence and global food trade exacerbates their obesity epidemicobjective: we sought to estimate how serosorting may affect hiv prevalence and individual risk among msm in seattle washington and how the results vary under different assumptions of hiv testing frequency heterogeneity in sexual behavior and condom use methods: we developed a deterministic mathematical model of hiv transmission dynamics data from the 2003 random digit dial study of msm conducted in seattle washington (n = 400) are used to parameterize the model results: predicted population-level hiv prevalence as well as an individualäó»s risk of hiv acquisition decreases when the odds of serosorting are increased in the mathematical model in our model based on observed levels of serosorting we predict an hiv prevalence of 16% in contrast if serosorting were eliminated in the population we predict that hiv prevalence would increase to 245% however our findings depend on rates of condom use mean anal sex contact rates and hiv testing in the population conclusions: under realistic scenarios of sexual behavior and testing frequency for msm in the us serosorting can be an effective harm reduction strategyduring pregnancy and postpartum women in high hiv prevalence regions continue to be at high risk for acquiring hiv due to both behavioral and biological mechanisms despite declines in coital frequency as a pregnancy advances we estimated differences in rates of partnership concurrency for men with and without pregnant or postpartum sexual partners we used monthly retrospective panel data from ghana from three perspectives: couple-level data female reports of pregnancy and male partner concurrency and male reports of concurrent partnerships and female partner pregnancy coital frequency increased during the first trimester and then declined with advancing pregnancy however in all three analyses there was no compelling evidence that men with pregnant or postpartum partners had additional concurrent partnerships our findings suggest that even though womenäó»s sexual activity likely declines during pregnancy and postpartum they may not be at increased risk of hiv/sti due to their partners seeking additional partnershipscities play an important role in fostering and amplifying the transmission of airborne diseases (eg influenza) because of dense human contacts before an outbreak of airborne diseases within a city how to determine an appropriate containment area for effective vaccination strategies is unknown this research treats airborne disease spreads as geo-social interaction patterns because viruses transmit among different groups of people over geographical locations through human interactions and population movement previous research argued that an appropriate scale identified through human geo-social interaction patterns can provide great potential for effective vaccination however little work has been done to examine the effectiveness of such vaccination at large scales (eg city) that are characterized by spatially heterogeneous population distribution and movement this article therefore aims to understand the impact of geo-social interaction patterns on effective vaccination in the urbanized area of portland oregon to achieve this goal we simulate influenza transmission on a large-scale location-based social network to 1) identify human geo-social interaction patterns for designing effective vaccination strategies and 2) and evaluate the efficacy of different vaccination strategies according to the identified geo-social patterns the simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of vaccination strategies based on geo-social interaction patterns in containing the epidemic outbreak at the source this research can provide evidence to inform public health approaches to determine effective scales in the design of disease control strategiespopulation mobility comes in heterogeneous forms and is triggered by many drivers the diverse contexts of mobility can significantly influence the effectiveness of hiv prevention and care as the contributions to this volume highlight nevertheless some fundamental concepts are common across various forms of mobility two such concepts are time and sexual networks: mobility occurs in a spaceäó\\x90time continuum and migrants are situated within social and sexual networks in this viewpoint we argue that a closer examination of how (1) time scales of mobility and (2) sexual network characteristics of migrants present challenges to effective hiv prevention can help to optimize interventions',\n",

gives an example and describes the use of the ontology in recent research projectsin this paper we develop a semantic annotation technique for location-based social networks to automatically annotate all places with category tags which are a crucial prerequisite for location search recommendation services or data cleaning our annotation algorithm learns a binary support vector machine (svm) classifier for each tag in the tag space to support multi-label classification based on the check-in behavior of users we extract features of places from i) explicit patterns (ep) of individual places and ii) implicit relatedness (ir) among similar places the features extracted from ep are summarized from all check-ins at a specific place the features from ir are derived by building a novel network of related places (nrp) where similar places are linked by virtual edges upon nrp we determine the probability of a category tag for each place by exploring the relatedness of places finally we

mapping between the ogc and the semantic web world finally we point out how to combine sdi with linked datathe spatial diffusion of information is a process governed by the flow of interpersonal communication the emergence of the internet and especially social media platforms has reshaped this process and previous research has studied how online social networks contribute to the diffusion of information understanding such processes can help devise methods to maximize or control the reach of information or even identify upcoming events and social movements yet activities in cyberspace are still confined to physical locations and this geographic connection tends to be overlooked in this research we focus on geographic regions instead of individuals and study how the underlying hierarchical structure of regions relates to their response to the information we examined the top 30 populated cities and metropolitan areas in the us and retrieved twitter data related to two selected topics from these regions the 2015 nepal earthquake and the #jesuischarlie hashtag in response to the paris attacks on the charlie hebdo offices we analyzed the similarity among regions of their response using multiple statistical methods and three urban classifications our results indicate that the diffusion of information is impacted by the hierarchy of urban regions and that the twitter responses act more similar when the populated regions are positioned at the same level in the urban hierarchyrecent years have witnessed a rapid increase in question answering (qa) research and products in both academic and industry however geographic question answering remained nearly untouched although geographic questions account for a substantial part of daily communication compared to general qa systems geographic qa has its own uniqueness one of which can be seen during the process of handling unanswerable questions since users typically focus on the geographic constraints when they ask questions if the question is unanswerable based on the knowledge base used by a qa system users should be provided with a relaxed query which takes distance decay into account during the query relaxation and rewriting process in this work we present a spatially explicit translational knowledge graph embedding model called transgeo which utilizes an edge-weighted pagerank and sampling strategy to encode the distance decay into the embedding model training process this embedding model is further applied to relax and rewrite unanswerable geographic questions we carry out two evaluation tasks: link prediction as well as query relaxation/rewriting for an approximate answer prediction task a geographic knowledge graph training/testing dataset db18 as well as an unanswerable

global positioning system software was used to determine random sampling locations across hong kong weighted by population density the resulting sample of 1023 participants (465% female mean age 4074 years) were invited to complete questionnaires on emergency preparedness barriers to evacuation and self-efficacy latent profile analysis and multinomial logistic regression were used to identify self-efficacy profiles and predictors of profile membership results: only 11% of the sample reported feeling prepared to respond to a disaster if asked to evacuate in an emergency 419% of the sample cited significant issues that would preclude them from doing so self-efficacy was negatively associated with barriers to disaster response so that participants reporting higher levels of self-efficacy cited fewer perceived barriers to evacuation conclusions: hong kong has established effective strategies for emergency response but concerns regarding evacuation and mobilisation remain the findings indicate that improving self-efficacy for disaster response has potential to increase evacuation readinessobjectives: to assess the level of all-hazards disaster preparedness and training needs of emergency department (ed) doctors and nurses in hong kong from their perspective and identify factors associated with high perceived personal preparedness design: this study was a cross-sectional territory-wide online survey conducted from 9 september to 26 october 2015 participants: the participants were doctors from the hong kong college of emergency medicine and nurses from the hong kong

different age groups with a focus on the family caregivers of elderly residents there is a need to promulgate first-aid training and disaster education in the communitythe rohingya people of myanmar have been subject to human rights violations through government-sponsored discrimination and violence since august 2017 an intensified assault by myanmar authorities has resulted in a rapid increase of rohingya pouring into bangladesh and the expansion of refugee settlements in the district of coxäó»s bazar has strained humanitarian and government relief efforts assessing rohingya and host community needs is critical for prioritizing resource allocations and for documenting the rights violations suffered by rohingya refugees from march 15 to 18 2018 we conducted a rapid needs assessment of recently arrived rohingya and host community households we collected data on demographics mortality education livelihoods access to food and water vaccination and health care among other things our survey found high levels of mortality among young rohingya men alarmingly low levels of vaccination among children poor literacy and rising poverty denied formal refugee status the rohingya cannot access due protections and find themselves in a state of insecurity in which they are unsure of their future and unable to formally seek work or send their children to school while the government of bangladesh explores the options of repatriation relocation and third-country resettlement for these refugees it is important to ensure that they are not denied a life of dignitybackground: quantifying the effect of natural disasters on society is critical for recovery of public health services and infrastructure the death toll can be difficult to assess in the aftermath of a major disaster in september 2017 hurricane maria caused massive infrastructural damage to puerto rico but its effect on mortality remains contentious the official death count is 64 methods: using a representative stratified sample we surveyed 3299 randomly chosen households across puerto rico to produce an independent estimate of all-cause mortality after the hurricane respondents were asked about displacement infrastructure loss and causes of death we calculated excess deaths by comparing our estimated post-hurricane mortality rate with official rates for the same period in 2016 results: from the survey data we estimated a mortality rate of 143 deaths (95% confidence interval [ci] 98 to 189) per 1000 persons from september 20 through december 31 2017 this rate yielded a total of 4645 excess deaths during this period (95% ci 793 to 8498) equivalent to a 62% increase in the mortality rate as compared with the same period in 2016 however this number is likely to be an underestimate because of survivor bias the mortality rate remained high through the end of december 2017 and one third of the deaths were attributed to delayed or interrupted health care hurricane-related migration was substantial conclusions: this household-based survey suggests that the number of excess deaths related to hurricane maria in puerto rico is more than 70 times the official estimate (funded by the harvard th chan school of public health and others)background: the rohingya people of myanmar have been subject to government-sponsored discrimination detention violence and torture causing several waves of a mass exodus to bangladesh since august 2017 when the latest wave of migration began there has been a rapid expansion of refugee camps in coxäó»s bazar bangladesh with camps now accommodating approximately 335000 new refugees in this rapidly changing scenario assessing the needs of the rohingya and the host communities in coxäó»s bazar is critical for prioritizing resource allocation we conducted a rapid needs assessment survey in both the rohingya and host communities in coxäó»s bazar to highlight the most pressing needs in the community methods: we conducted a randomized survey of 402 recently-arrived rohingya households and 400 households in the local host community from march 15 to march 18 2018 the survey collected information on household demographics mortality education of all members income and livelihoods access to food and water vaccination and access and utilization of healthcare we calculated descriptive statistics and appropriate standard errors for survey responses on these topics findings: the sampled rohingya households were younger than the host community households two-thirds of the reported deaths in the rohingya households in the last 12 months were among male household members with a low overall mean age at death (387 years) the majority (76\\x8c\\x870%) of rohingya household members above the age of 15 reported having had no education and 52\\x8c\\x876% of rohingya children were not attending school nearly all (93\\x8c\\x875%) rohingya households reported a decrease in income over the last 12 months with 799% reporting no current income mean reported income in the host community was not significantly different between 2018 and the previous two years we found high levels of reported food insecurity among the rohingya which was also reflected in their prioritization of food over all else if provided additional cash assistance and in their borrowing money to procure food the majority (61\\x8c\\x877%) of rohingya children under two had received zero doses of injectable vaccines in myanmar and of them 24\\x8c\\x878% had also not received any injectable vaccines in bangladesh for oral vaccines 57\\x8c\\x875% of children under two had received zero doses in myanmar of whom 29\\x8c\\x876% had also not received any oral doses in bangladesh in comparison children in the host community had much higher rates of vaccination some rohingya households reported challenges in accessing healthcare (14\\x8c\\x872%) with the majority reporting distance to a healthcare facility as the main cause in the host community 32\\x8c\\x875% of all surveyed households reported issues accessing healthcare with wide variation (0 to 57\\x8c\\x876%) among locations interpretation: the results of this rapid needs assessment offer important insights into the most pressing challenges facing the rohingya while providing contextual information about the neighboring bangladeshi communities hosting them the rohingya population is greatly impoverished with very low levels of education while growing evidence globally demonstrates the prudence in formally integrating refugees into the labor force doing so in bangladesh will entail strategic investment in imparting skills and education to the host and migrant populations with a particular focus on women resources should also be allocated to address pressing needs such as food shortages and vaccination gaps',\n",

human travel and locating high-risk sites of parasite importation could greatly improve malaria control programs here we use spatially explicit mobile phone data and malaria prevalence information from kenya to identify the dynamics of human carriers that drive parasite importation between regions our analysis identifies importation routes that contribute to malaria epidemiology on regional spatial scalesmobile social real-time: the ongoing revolution in the way people communicate has given rise to a new kind of epidemiology digital data sources when harnessed appropriately can provide local and timely information about disease and health dynamics in populations around the world the rapid unprecedented increase in the availability of relevant data from various digital sources creates considerable technical and computational challengesmathematical models of mosquito-borne pathogen transmission originated in the early twentieth century to provide insights into how to most effectively combat malaria the foundations of the rossäóñmacdonald theory were established by 1970 since then there has been a growing interest in reducing the public health burden of mosquito-borne pathogens and an expanding use of models to guide their control to assess how theory has changed to confront evolving public health challenges we compiled a bibliography of 325 publications from 1970 through 2010 that included at least one mathematical model of mosquito-borne pathogen transmission and then used a 79-part questionnaire to classify each of 388 associated models according to its biological assumptions as a composite measure to interpret the multidimensional results of our survey we assigned a numerical value to each model that measured its similarity to 15 core assumptions of the rossäóñmacdonald model although the analysis illustrated a growing acknowledgement of geographical ecological and epidemiological complexities in modelling transmission most models during the past 40 years closely resemble the rossäóñmacdonald model modern theory would benefit from an expansion around the concepts of heterogeneous mosquito biting poorly mixed mosquito-host encounters spatial

2äó\\x8amonths results: most travel was in the south of the study region between coxäó»s bazar district (coastal region) to forested areas in bandarban (31% by days and 45% by nights) forming a source-sink route less than 1% of travel reported was between the north and south forested areas of the study area farmers (21%) and students (19%) were the top two occupations recorded with 67 and

framework for identifying key traveller groups and their origins and destinations of travel in combination with knowledge of local epidemiology to inform malaria control and elimination efforts working with the nmep the findings were used to derive a set of policy recommendations to guide targeting of interventions for eliminationforecasting the spatiotemporal spread of infectious diseases during an outbreak is an important component of epidemic response however it remains challenging both methodologically and with respect to data requirements as disease spread is influenced by numerous factors including the pathogenäó»s underlying transmission parameters and epidemiological dynamics social networks and population connectivity and environmental conditions here using data from sierra leone we analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of recent cholera and ebola outbreaks and compare and contrast the spread of these two pathogens in the same population we develop a simulation model of the spatial spread of an epidemic in order to examine the impact of a pathogenäó»s incubation period on the dynamics of spread and the predictability of outbreaks we find that differences in the incubation period alone can determine the limits of predictability for diseases with different natural history both empirically and in our simulations our results show that diseases with longer incubation periods such as ebola where infected individuals can travel farther before becoming infectious result in more long-distance sparking events and less predictable disease trajectories as compared to the more predictable wave-like spread of diseases with shorter incubation periods such as cholerain the wake of the rohingya population's mass migration from myanmar one of the world's largest refugee settlements was constructed in cox's bazar bangladesh to accommodate nearly 900000 new refugees refugee populations are particularly vulnerable to infectious disease outbreaks due to many population and environmental factors a large measles outbreak with over 1700 cases occurred among the rohingya population between september and november 2017 here we estimate key epidemiological parameters and use a dynamic mathematical model of measles transmission to evaluate the effectiveness of the reactive vaccination campaigns in the refugee camps we also estimate the potential for subsequent outbreaks under different vaccination coverage scenarios our modeling results highlight the success of the vaccination campaigns in rapidly curbing transmission and emphasize the public health importance of maintaining high levels of vaccination in this population where high birth rates and historically low vaccination coverage rates create suitable conditions for future measles

atmosphereäóñbiophysicaläóñhydrologic response to altered climate forcing at local watershed and regional basin scalesdenitrification the anaerobic reduction of nitrogen oxides to nitrogenous gases is an extremely challenging process to measure and model much of this challenge arises from the fact that small areas (hotspots) and brief periods (hot moments) frequently account for a high percentage of the denitrification activity that occurs in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in this paper we describe the prospects for incorporating hotspot and hot moment phenomena into denitrification models in terrestrial soils the interface between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and in aquatic ecosystems our analysis suggests that while our data needs are strongest for hot moments the greatest modeling challenges are for hotspots given the increasing availability of high temporal frequency climate data models are promising tools for evaluating the importance of hot moments such as freeze-thaw cycles and drying/rewetting events spatial hotspots are less tractable due to our inability to get high resolution spatial approximations of denitrification drivers such as carbon substrate investigators need to consider the types of hotspots and hot moments that might be occurring at small medium and large spatial scales in the particular ecosystem type they are working in before starting a study or developing a new model new experimental design and heterogeneity quantification tools can then be applied from the outset and will result in better quantification and more robust and widely applicable denitrification modelsprocess-based models that can represent multiple and interacting processes provide a framework for combining field-based measurements with evolving

societyäó\\x90relevant problems and that uses new technologies and modelling approaches to accomplish these goals both the discussions within the agu ecohydrology tc and the analysis of the activities in the larger ecohydrology field (through the invited mlrs perspectives and recently highly cited papers) revealed a growing interest in studies that relate to core societal issues: climate change and increasing pressures from land use and urbanization on water ecology and their interaction our community however often makes progress on these issues by addressing more specific incremental questionsäóîby using new data new techniques new collaborations and new ways of looking at systems to learn more about how water and ecosystems interact the agu ecohydrology leaf blog documents the diversity of how individual ecohydrologists are addressing challenges perhaps reflecting the core interdisciplinarity of ecohydrology many of the ecohydrologists that we interviewed seek to advance the field through crossäó\\x90disciplinary collaboration and cite influential papers as those that either support interdisciplinarity or provide salient examples concurrent with this are influential papers and research directions that focus on specific ecohydrologic processes and mechanisms and on the use of new techniques and approaches to learn about specific processes even though review papers

diverse set of audiencesäóîfrom young students to experts and from the public to resource managers and policy makersforest disturbances such as wildfire and drought-related disease often lead to declines in productivity that both influence and are influenced by forest water use particularly in the semi-arid environments of the western us fuel treatments are frequently proposed to reduce vulnerability to these drought-related impacts and in some cases as an approach to increase water yield by changing ecosystem structure fuel treatments alter ecosystem function (including hydrologic cycling carbon sequestration energy partitioning and biogeochemical cycling) empirical studies of the impacts of changing ecosystem structure either through active forest management or through natural disturbances show a wide range of responses that include both increases and decreases in forest water use variation in climate and species as well as the magnitude of forest density reduction are commonly proposed as explanations for this variation in this paper we use a coupled eco-hydrologic model to demonstrate that subsurface features are likely to be a critical but often over-looked factor that influences forest water use and regeneration following density reduction treatments using a case study site in the southern sierra nevada mountains of california we show that whether forest water use increases or decreases following density reduction as well as the magnitude and rate of recovery of hydrologic changes depends strongly on plant accessible water storage capacity within the rooting zone and the extent to which the root structures of neighboring trees interact and share water we find that in some cases density reduction can increase water yield and productivity of remaining trees for the first few years following treatment however we also show that when soils are shallow and roots systems overlap counter-intuitive increases in water use and related declines in productivity can occur due to water stress results highlight the importance of accounting for site-specific variation such as soil water storage capacity in assessing how fuel treatments may interact with ecosystem water use and drought vulnerability and ultimately downslope impacts on streamflowfire suppression in western us mountains has caused dense forests with high water demands to grow restoring natural wildfire regimes to these forests could affect hydrology by changing vegetation composition and structure but the specific effects on water balance are unknown mountain watersheds supply water to much of the western united states so understanding the relationship between fire regime and water yield is essential to inform management we used a distributed hydrological model to quantify hydrologic response to a restored fire regime in the illilouette creek basin (icb) within yosemite national park california over the past 45 years as successive fires reduced the icb's forest cover approximately 25% model results show that annual streamflow subsurface water storage and peak snowpack increased relative to a fire-suppressed control while evapotranspiration and climatic water deficit decreased a second model experiment compared the water balance in the icb under two vegetation cover scenarios: 2012 vegetation representing a frequent-fire landscape and 1969 vegetation representing fire suppression these two model landscapes were run with observed weather data from 1972 to 2017 in order to capture natural variations in precipitation and temperature this experiment showed that wet years experienced greater fire-related reductions in evapotranspiration and increases in streamflow while reductions in climatic water deficit were greater in dry years spring snowmelt runoff was higher under burned conditions while summer baseflow was relatively unaffected restoring wildfire to the fire-suppressed icb likely increased downstream water availability shifted streamflows slightly earlier and reduced water stress to forests\",\n",

forestation and discourage deforestationäóîas part of the domestic portfolio of compliance activities we investigate the cost of forest-based carbon sequestration by analyzing econometrically micro-data on revealed landowner preferences modeling six major private land uses in a comprehensive analysis of the contiguous united states the econometric estimates are used to simulate landowner responses to sequestration policies we treat key commodity prices as endogenous and predict carbon storage changes with a carbon sink model our estimated sequestration costs exceed those from previous engineering cost analyses and sectoral optimization models our estimated sequestration supply function is similar to the carbon abatement supply function from energy-based analyses suggesting that forest-based carbon sequestration merits consideration in a cost-effective portfolio of domestic us climate change strategiesproviding food timber energy housing and other goods and services while maintaining ecosystem functions and biodiversity that underpin their sustainable supply is one of the great challenges of our time understanding the drivers of land-use change and how policies can alter land-use change will be critical to meeting this challenge here we project land-use change in the contiguous united states to 2051 under two plausible baseline trajectories of economic conditions to illustrate how differences in underlying market forces can have large impacts on land-use with cascading effects on ecosystem services and wildlife habitat we project a large increase in croplands (282 million ha) under a scenario with high crop demand mirroring conditions starting in 2007 compared with a loss of cropland (112 million ha) mirroring conditions in the 1990s projected land-use changes result in increases in carbon storage timber production food production from increased yields and >10% decreases in habitat for 25% of modeled species we also analyze policy alternatives designed to encourage forest cover and natural landscapes and reduce urban expansion although these policy scenarios modify baseline land-use patterns they do not reverse powerful underlying trends policy interventions need to be aggressive to significantly alter underlying land-use change trends and shift the trajectory of ecosystem service provisionwe develop an integrated model to predict private land-use decisions in response to policy incentives designed to increase the provision of carbon sequestration and species conservation across heterogeneous landscapes using data from the willamette basin oregon we compare the provision of carbon sequestration and species conservation under five simple policies that offer payments for conservation we evaluate policy performance compared with the maximum feasible combinations of carbon sequestration and species conservation on the landscape for various conservation budgets none of the conservation payment policies produce increases in carbon sequestration and species conservation that approach the maximum potential gains on the landscape our results show that policies aimed at increasing the provision of carbon sequestration do not necessarily increase species conservation and that highly targeted policies do not necessarily do as well as more general policiesgrowing evidence suggests that drought risk is increasing due to climate change evaluation of potential policy responses involves understanding complex economic tradeoffs hydrologic and social feedbacks and recognizing how combinations of interventions may have complementary or conflicting effects this paper explores the potential that coupled humanäóñnatural system models have to address these questions we employ a detailed model of the willamette river basin oregon to evaluate the effectiveness of a variety of potential drought policy interventions to conserve or reallocate water during a simulated near-term drought year the drought year is characterized by early-season low flows that make it impossible to meet water demands the results indicate that while the policies are effective at conserving water they have limited ability to mitigate the shortages because the timing and location of conservation responses do not match the timing and location of the shortagesthis paper examines how behavioral biases caused by salient events affect the government provision of public goods we develop a theory in which competing communities lobby the government for allocations of a local public good salient events bias community demands for the good which results in inefficient allocations we empirically test this theory using salient wildfires and government projects to reduce wildfire risk wildfires reduce risk to nearby communities but may increase demand for fuels management projects because of biases induced by salient wildfires we find that communities experiencing recent nearby fires are more likely to receive fuels management projects (jel d03 h41 q24)markets especially land markets can facilitate climate change adaptation through price signals a review of research reveals that urban coastal and agricultural land markets provide effective signals of the emerging costs of climate change these signals encourage adjustments by both private owners and policy officials in taking preemptive action to reduce costs in agriculture they promote consideration of new cropping and tillage practices seed types timing and location of production they also stimulate use of new irrigation technologies in urban areas they motivate new housing construction elevation and location away from harm they channel more efficient use of water and its application to parks and other green areas to make urban settings more desirable with higher temperatures related water markets play a similar role in adjusting water use and reallocation to be effective however markets must reflect multiple traders and prices must be free to adjust where these conditions are not met market signals will be inhibited and market-driven adaptation will be reduced because public policy is driven by constituent demands it may not be a remedy the evidence of the national flood insurance program and federal wildfire response illustrates how politically difficult it may be to adjust programs to be more adaptive',\n",

       " ('fire is a worldwide phenomenon that appears in the geological record soon after the appearance of terrestrial plants fire influences global ecosystem patterns and processes including vegetation distribution and structure the carbon cycle and climate although humans and fire have always coexisted our capacity to manage fire remains imperfect and may become more difficult in the future as climate change alters fire regimes this risk is difficult to assess however because fires are still poorly represented in global models here we discuss some of the most important issues involved in developing a better understanding of the role of fire in the earth systemclimate change is expected to alter the geographic distribution of wildfire a complex abiotic process that responds to a variety of spatial and environmental gradients how future climate change may alter global wildfire activity however is still largely unknown as a first step to quantifying potential change in global wildfire we present a multivariate quantification of environmental drivers for the observed current distribution of vegetation fires using statistical models of the relationship between fire activity and resources to burn climate conditions human influence and lightning flash rates at a coarse spatiotemporal resolution (100 km over one decade) we then demonstrate how these statistical models can be used to project future changes in global fire patterns highlighting regional hotspots of change in fire probabilities under future climate conditions as simulated by a global climate model based on current conditions our results illustrate how the availability of resources to burn and climate conditions conducive to combustion jointly determine why some parts of the world are fire-prone and others are fire-free in contrast to any expectation that global warming should necessarily result in more fire we find that regional increases in fire probabilities may be counter-balanced by decreases at other locations due to the interplay of temperature and precipitation variables despite this net balance our models predict substantial invasion and retreat of fire across large portions of the globe these changes could have important effects on terrestrial ecosystems since alteration in fire activity may occur quite rapidly generating ever more complex environmental challenges for species dispersing and adjusting to new climate conditions our findings highlight the potential for widespread impacts of climate change on wildfire suggesting severely altered fire regimes and the need for more explicit inclusion of fire in research on global vegetation-climate change dynamics and conservation planninghumans and their ancestors are unique in being a fireäó\\x90making species but äóönaturaläó» (ie independent of humans) fires have an ancient geological history on earth natural fires have influenced biological evolution and global biogeochemical cycles making fire integral to the functioning of some biomes globally debate rages about the impact on ecosystems of prehistoric humanäó\\x90set fires with views ranging from catastrophic to negligible understanding of the diversity of human fire regimes on earth in the past present and future remains rudimentary it remains uncertain how humans have caused a departure from äóönaturaläó» background levels that vary with climate change available evidence shows that modern humans can increase or decrease background levels of natural fire activity by clearing forests promoting grazing dispersing plants altering ignition patterns and actively suppressing fires thereby causing substantial ecosystem changes and loss of biodiversity some of these contemporary fire regimes cause substantial economic disruptions owing to the destruction of infrastructure degradation of ecosystem services loss of life and smokeäó\\x90related health effects these episodic disasters help frame negative public attitudes towards landscape fires despite the need for burning to sustain some ecosystems greenhouse gasäó\\x90induced warming and changes in the hydrological cycle may increase the occurrence of large severe fires with potentially significant feedbacks to the earth system improved understanding of human fire regimes demands: (1) better data on past and current human influences on fire regimes to enable global comparative analyses (2) a greater understanding of different cultural traditions of landscape burning and their positive and negative social economic and ecological effects and (3) more realistic representations of anthropogenic fire in global vegetation and climate change models we provide an historical framework to promote understanding of the development and diversification of fire regimes covering the preäó\\x90human period human domestication of fire and the subsequent transition from subsistence agriculture to industrial economies all of these phases still occur on earth providing opportunities for comparative researchclimate change is one of the most challenging scientific and political issues of our time from a scientific perspective the evidence regarding human induced warming of the climate system is unequivocal ct 2(ipcc 2014) a complex dynamic process of unprecedented environmental change has reached severe levels inaugurating a new age of environmental breakdown (national economic and social council [nesc] 2019) anticipated climate change not only means changes in global average temperatures but also changes to the frequency and intensity of extreme weather and climate events such as severe flooding high precipitation events and storms droughts wildfires and heat/cold waves in addition to increasing threats posed by sea level rises while there is an overwhelming scientific consensus that human-induced climate change is happening translating this knowledge into action remains an enduring challenge as buckley and betsill (2003) observe questions as to what should be done by whom and when remain highly contested while mitigating climate change and transitioning to a zero carbon society is paramount policymakers are increasingly promoting adaptation strategies as a means of coping with anticipated climate change risks future uncertainties continuing high levels of carbon emissions and the failure of international agreements and large economies to limit emissions indeed even if emissions are stopped immediately temperatures will remain elevated for centuries due to the effect of greenhouse gases from past human emissions already present in the atmosphere (zickfeld et al 2013) in this interface we explore one aspect of adaptation: addressing the question of whether to äóöresist or retreatäó» in areas vulnerable to extreme climate change risks including sea level rise flooding wildfires heatwaves tropical storms and land instability or erosion at a global level the impact of climate disruption is potentially catastrophic including widespread displacement of people as parts of the globe become less habitable due to excessive heat drought or inundation from sea level rise for example in a recent study published in nature communications kulp and strauss (2019) estimate that under a moderate scenario consistent with 2\\x8các warming äóìsea levels projected by 2050 are high enough to threaten land currently home to a total of 150 million people to a future permanently below the high tide line    [and] a total of 360 million people are [currently living] on land threatened by annual flood events in 2100äó\\x9d (pp 2äóñ3) under a high emissions scenario kulp and strauss estimate that up to 630 million people currently live on land below projected annual flood levels for 2100 their study further highlights that 70 per cent of the total number of people worldwide currently living on vulnerable land are located in eight asian countries: china bangladesh india vietnam indonesia thailand the philippines and japan this indicates a complex interaction of political and ethical issues that requires social science scrutiny to identify understand and provide informed solutions to the existential challenges posed by climate change hence this interface seeks to stimulate debate in planning theory and practice on the interaction of these climate risks with urbanisation processes thereby emphasising the role of spatial planning within wider adaptive governance dealing directly with the increasing äóìhazardousness of placeäó\\x9d (black et al 2011) environmental hazards related to current and future climate change have the potential to cause enormous damage to the built environment housing and commercial property and critical physical and social infrastructure imposing significant social and financial costs (oäó»neill & scott 2011) in a european context the impacts of a warming climate and more extreme weather events are already being experienced a report by the european environment agency [eea] (2010) highlights that extreme temperature events across europe between 1998äóñ2009 caused over 77000 fatalities while flooding and storm events were the most costly hazards accounting for ä\\x89å96 billion in losses (primarily damage to property and critical infrastructure) across europe climate change has led to detectable changes in extreme weather (eg heatwaves intense precipitation) increasing exposure of people and the built environment to climate disruption (disaster damages) leading to an observed increase in economic losses (disaster losses) (eea 2017) indeed at the time of writing (december 2019) flooding issues in the uk have made their way into national electoral debates indicating how the sometimes abstract language of climate change science is materialised for people in the tangible experience of place disruption resulting in political mobilisation and dispute reflecting such dynamics the european environment agency (eea 2016) notes that äóìclimate change is not isolated; it is strongly intertwined with socio-economic factors that make it a systemic challengeäó\\x9d (p 16) in relation to the hazardousness of place this includes real estate markets property rights residential consumer choices and mobilities management and regulation of land-use and urbanization in other words vulnerability to sea-level rise fluvial flooding heat stress and wildfires increase not only through a changing climate but also continued urban development in inappropriate locations (such as on flood plains) or the design of our cities (eg through intensifying urban heat island effects) an illustrative example is provided by the increasing risk of wildfires which over the last decade have caused devastating property losses in many parts of the world including australia southern europe and california (kramer mockrin alexandre & radeloff 2019) while wildfires have been longstanding hazards within these regions the last decade has witnessed a growing intensity of wildfires resulting from increasing drought conditions warmer weather and record-breaking heatwaves indeed reports suggest that ten of californiaäó»s most destructive wildfires have occurred in the last decade alongside drier hotter weather (schoen & mcdonald 2019) as recorded by sharples et al (2016) in australia over the past decade or so major bushfires at the ex-urban margins of sydney canberra and melbourne have burnt more than a million hectares of forests and woodlands and resulted in the loss of more than 200 lives and 4000 homes moreover sharples et al note that the loss of property and life are increasing in major urban expansion areas in australia prompting questions about the changing nature of fire events characterised by increasing frequency intensity and the development of catastrophic äóöfire stormsäó» in such densely populated areas at the time of writing (december 2019) two australian states have declared a state of emergency as bushfires bring a catastrophic threat to heavily populated areas along the eastern coast with the media reporting on thousands of residents being displaced in new south wales with more than 120 bushfires burning across the state (bbc 2019) the vulnerability of communities and property to wildfires however is not simply due to a changing climate but also consolidated by urbanisation patterns particularly in amenity rich peri-urban and rural areas for example 25 per cent of californiaäó»s population (11 million people) live in fire prone areas (berger & susskind 2018) often in affluent communities in semi-rural locations characterised by amenity-led migration (marcouiller clendenning & kedzior 2002) as noted by radeloff et al (2018) the wildland-urban interface (where wildfires are most prevalent) in the us has witnessed rapid development with the number of new houses rising from 308 m to 434 m or 41 per cent growth not only are these houses being accommodated in areas vulnerable to wildfires but a growing population results in greater risk of wildfire ignitions in turn putting more lives and houses at risk (radeloff et al 2018) land-use patterns (and regulation) and humaninduced climate disruption are combining to increase vulnerability to risk (syphard rustigianromsos mann conlisk moritz & ackerly 2019) in order to preserve and enhance peopleäó»s quality of life in our urban rural and coastal communities we will have to develop a repertoire of adaptation planning methods and toolkits in order to cope with climate disruption a business-as-usual approach will further entrench unsustainable path dependencies such as building on flood plains or within fire prone areas which will prove more costly to protect or adapt in the future planning for retreat is likely to be part of the adaptive mix of options entailing a widening of the normative framing around adaptation beyond protection and greater transparency in assessing risks options and implementation pathways (lesnikowski et al 2017) within this context a key theme across all the contributions to this interface is the need to place equity and justice as central in planning practices dealing with affected communities äóñ in other words just adaptation to the climate emergency while these climate-related environmental risks represent complex challenges campbell (2006) reminds us that planners have a long track record of tackling äóöwicked problemsäó» which urgently need to be applied in the face of a growing climate emergency the interface begins with daniel tubridy mick lennon and mark scott exploring the framing of adaptation responses and the tensions between an approach based on protecting against climate damage through äóöresistanceäó» to a planned retreat from vulnerable areas in the face of a climate emergency while outlining the benefits of the latter tubridy et al also note the complexity of planning for retreat including from an equity perspective a communityäó»s sense of loss and also emerging models of dealing with relocation beyond simple compensation based approaches building on this latter theme patrick marchman ar siders kelly leilani main victoria herrmann and debra butler provide insights from the work of the climigration network in the us the network comprises a group of academics artists community leaders and adaptation professionals who work with affected communities dealing with relocation due to risk from climate hazards they argue that framing äóöretreatäó» as a single adaptation response often fails to recognise specific and variable contexts that make relocations complex and contested instead calling for a more nuanced approach from planners and adaptation professionals in responding to climate risks while a complex process marchman et al outline an agenda for planning practice that builds on traditional planning skills combined with a willingness to experiment and to place equity as central to any adaptation strategies the following contribution by kathryn frank outlines an insightful case study from florida state which the author highlights can be considered äóöground zeroäó» for climate related hazards in the us despite growing risks from sea level rise storm surges and more frequent hurricanes frank outlines a tendency towards a business as usual approach particularly in relation to expensive coastal estate markets drawing on action-based research frank argues for a pragmatic planning approach which encourages planners to avoid a simplistic short term focus on physical protection (which enables continued development) towards an approach based on äóöretreat and avoidanceäó» which accepts and manages economic decline and copes with trauma and loss moving from coastal retreat the next contribution draws on the authorsäó» experience of working in fire prone areas in australia karyn bosomworth and raphaele blanchi explore housing choices and whether people take into account climate hazards in choosing where to live this contribution examines the intersection of land-use regulation and disaster risk reduction and challenges planning practice to confront the question: at what point will a location be deemed uninhabitable because of potential future risks this also requires planning authorities to prevent development in unsuitable locations that will further entrench future vulnerability the final contribution moves from examining risk and retreat in the global north to examine the impacts of increasing vulnerability in precarious urban settlements in the global south context cassidy johnson highlights that in a global south context urban risks are a culmination of climate change related vulnerability plus development deficits in particular johnson focuses on informal settlements which are often located in very exposed locations (eg low lying land unstable land) without any physical infrastructure to cope with risk and overlapping with poverty and an absence of political voice people living in these areas have limited choices and often balance everyday risk with opportunities to live closer to work opportunities or close to family networks johnsonäó»s contribution critiques the common practice of resettlement often involving forcible eviction from informal settlements through top-down interventions instead johnson argues that resettlement needs to framed within long-term sustainable development for affected communities rather than as a short term means for risk reduction as with the other contributions to this interface the final paper places equity and justice as central to any planning strategies for communities vulnerable to the climate emergencymacroecological studies have established widespread patterns of species diversity and abundance in ecosystems but have generally restricted their scope to relatively steady-state systems as a result how macroecological metrics are expected to scale in ecosystems that experience natural disturbance regimes is unknown we examine macroecological patterns in a fire-dependent forest of bishop pine (pinus muricata) we target two different-aged stands in a stand-replacing fire regime: a mature stand with a diverse understory and with no history of major disturbance for at least 40 yr and one disturbed by a stand-replacing fire 17 yr prior to measurement we compare properties of these stands with macroecological predictions from the maximum entropy theory of ecology (mete) an information entropy-based theory that has proven highly successful in predicting macroecological metrics in multiple ecosystems and taxa ecological patterns in the mature stand more closely match mete predictions than do data from the more recently disturbed mid-seral stage stand this suggests meteäó»s predictions are more robust in latesuccessional slowly changing or steady-state systems than those in rapid flux with respect to species composition abundances and organismsäó» sizes our findings highlight the need for a macroecological theory that incorporates natural disturbance perturbations and ecological dynamics into its predictive capabilities because most natural systems are not in a steady statewildfires are becoming larger and more frequent across much of the united states due to anthropogenic climate change no studies however have assessed fire prevaäó\\x90 lence in lake watersheds at broad spatial and temporal scales and thus it is unknown whether wildfires threaten lakes and reservoirs (hereafter lakes) of the united states we show that fire activity has increased in lake watersheds across the continental united states from 1984 to 2015 particularly since 2005 lakes have experienced the greatest fire activity in the western united states southern great plains and florida despite over 30 years of increasing fire exposure fire effects on fresh waters have not been well studied; previous research has generally focused on streams and most of the limited lakeäó\\x90fire research has been conducted in boreal landscapes we therefore propose a conceptual model of how fire may influence the physical chemiäó\\x90 cal and biological properties of lake ecosystems by synthesizing the best available science from terrestrial aquatic fire and landscape ecology this model also highäó\\x90 lights emerging research priorities and provides a starting point to help land and lake managers anticipate potential effects of fire on ecosystem services provided by fresh waters and their watersheds',\n",

its public health burden are poorly known25 here we undertake an exhaustive assembly of known records of dengue occurrence worldwide and use a formal modelling framework to map the global distribution of dengue risk we then pair the resulting risk map with detailed longitudinal information from dengue cohort studies and population surfaces to infer the public health burden of dengue in 2010 we predict dengue to be ubiquitous throughout the tropics with local spatial variations in risk influenced strongly by rainfall temperature and the degree of urbanisation using cartographic approaches we estimate there to be 390 million (95 percent credible interval 284-528) dengue infections per year of which 96 million (67-136) manifest apparently (any level of clinical or sub-clinical severity) this infection total is more than three times the dengue burden estimate of the world health organization2 stratification of our estimates by country allows comparison with national dengue reporting after taking into account the probability of an apparent infection being formally reported the most notable differences are discussed these new risk maps and infection estimates provide novel insights into the global regional and national public health burden imposed by dengue we anticipate that they will provide a starting point for a wider discussion about the global impact of this disease and will help guide improvements in disease control strategies using vaccine drug and vector control methods and in their economic evaluation the past two decades have seen an increasing number of virulent infectious diseases in natural populations and managed landscapes in both animals and plants an unprecedented number of fungal and fungal-like diseases have recently caused some of the most severe die-offs and extinctions ever witnessed in wild species and are jeopardizing food security human activity is intensifying fungal disease dispersal by modifying natural environments and thus

evidence quality and consistency giving each country an evidence consensus score using this approach we were able to generate a contemporary global map of national-level dengue status that assigns a relative measure of certainty and identifies gaps in the available evidence conclusion: the map produced here provides a list of 128 countries for which there is good evidence of dengue occurrence including 36 countries that have previously been classified as dengue-free by the world health organization and/or the us centers for disease control it also identifies disease surveillance needs which we list in full the disease extents and limits determined here using evidence consensus marks the beginning of a five-year study to advance the mapping of dengue virus transmission and disease risk completion of this first step has allowed us to produce a preliminary estimate of population at risk with an upper bound of 397 billion people this figure will be refined in future worklyme disease is the most common tick-borne disease in the northern hemisphere existing estimates of lyme disease spread are delayed a year or more we introduce lymelightäóîa new method for monitoring the incidence of lyme disease in real-time we use a machine-learned classifier of web search sessions to estimate the number of individuals who search for possible lyme disease symptoms in a given geographical area for two years 2014 and 2015 we evaluate lymelight using the official case count data from cdc and find a 92% correlation (p < 0001) at county level importantly using web search data allows us not only to assess the incidence of the disease but also to examine the appropriateness of treatments subsequently searched for by the users public health implications of our work include monitoring the spread of vector-borne diseases in a timely and scalable manner complementing existing approaches through real-time detection which can enable more timely interventions our analysis of

quality; outcomes; accountability transparency and regulation; fairness and equity; and efficiency of 1178 potentially relevant unique citations data were obtained from 102 articles describing studies conducted in low- and middle-income countries comparative cohort and cross-sectional studies suggested that providers in the private sector more frequently violated medical standards of practice and had poorer patient outcomes but had greater reported timeliness and hospitality to patients reported efficiency tended to be lower in the private than in the public sector resulting in part from perverse incentives for unnecessary testing and treatment public sector services experienced more limited availability of equipment medications and trained healthcare workers when the definition of \"private sector\" included unlicensed and uncertified providers such as drug shop owners most patients appeared to access care in the private sector;

       " (\"we have determined the structure of pvu ii methyltransferase (m pvu ii) complexed with s -adenosyl-l-methionine (adomet) by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction using a crystal of the selenomethionine-substituted protein m pvu ii catalyzes transfer of the methyl group from adomet to the exocyclic amino (n4) nitrogen of the central cytosine in its recognition sequence 5'-cagctg-3' the protein is dominated by an open alpha/beta-sheet structure with a prominent v-shaped cleft: adomet and catalytic amino acids are located at the bottom of this cleft the size and the basic nature of the cleft are consistent with duplex dna binding the target (methylatable) cytosine if flipped out of the double helical dna as seen for dna methyltransferases that generate 5-methylcytosine would fit into the concave active site next to the adomet this m pvu iialpha/beta-sheet structure is very similar to those of m hha i (a cytosine c5 methyltransferase) and m taq i (an adenine n6 methyltransferase) consistent with a model predicting that dna methyltransferases share a common structural fold while having the major functional regions permuted into three distinct linear orders the main feature of the common fold is a seven-stranded beta-sheet (6 7 5 4 1 2 3) formed by five parallel beta-strands and an antiparallel beta-hairpin the beta-sheet is flanked by six parallel alpha-helices three on each side the adomet binding site is located at the c-terminal ends of strands beta1 and beta2 and the active site is at the c-terminal ends of strands beta4 and beta5 and the n-terminal end of strand beta7 the adomet-protein interactions are almost identical among m pvu ii m hha i and m taq i as well as in an rna methyltransferase and at least one small molecule methyltransferase the structural similarity among the active sites of m pvu ii m taq i and m hha i reveals that catalytic amino acids essential for cytosine n4 and adenine n6 methylation coincide spatially with those for cytosine c5 methylation suggesting a mechanism for amino methylationobjective: to review the efficacy and safety of natural products commonly used for diabetes data sources: english and spanish-language journals retrieved through a medline search of articles published between 1960 and december 2001 using these index terms: opuntia karela gymnema tecoma alpha lipoic acid thioctic acid ginseng panaxans and diabetes data synthesis: natural products have long been used in traditional systems of medicine for diabetes products in common use include nopal (prickly pear cactus) fenu-greek karela (bitter melon) gymnema ginseng tronadora chromium and alpha-lipoic acid the popularity of these products varies among people of different ethnicities nopal is the most commonly used herbal hypoglycemic among persons of mexican descent karela is more commonly used by persons from asian countries some of these agents have gained universal appeal for a select number of products studies have revealed single or multiple mechanisms of action for several of these high soluble fiber content is a contributing factor conclusion: based on the available evidence several natural products in common use can lower blood glucose in patients with diabetes commonly used natural products often have a long history of traditional use and pharmacists who have a stronger understanding of these products are better positioned to counsel patients on their appropriate usediabetes is an epidemic of crisis proportion in the united states cases have increased fivefold since 1958 the focus of therapy management is tightly controlling blood glucose levels in order to reduce related health complications toward this end health care professionals need to know whether patients are using natural products that could affect these values certain ethnic groups have a higher incidence of diabetes and 24% of mexican americans aged 45 to 74 years have diabetes across all age groups latinos defined here as patients from mexico and central and south america are twice as likely to develop diabetes as non-latino white americans this patient population has traditionally used medicinal plants to control a variety of illnesses including hyperglycemiato manage patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus effectively and delay the onset of diabetesäó\\x90related complications therapeutic targets for glycemic control as recommended by the american diabetes association and the american association of clinical endocrinologists should be implemented in clinical practice initiation of treatment with insulin is a critical step in achieving target glycemic levels a variety of insulin formulations are available in the united states that can be matched to meet the diverse needs and lifestyles of patients with type 2 diabetes in particular insulin analogs have more predictable profiles of action and thus are able to more closely mimic physiologic insulin action case studies are presented to demonstrate the use of different types of insulin analogs in various situations as supported by data from clinical trials the needs of the individual patient are considered in terms of his or her particular preferences medical history and adjustments for lifestyle concerns the involvement of pharmacists in this individualized therapy is critical in order to enhance patients' understanding of their disease and their most effective treatment optionsbackground: type 2 diabetes (t2dm) is a major risk factor for developing cardiovascular disease (cvd) the growing epidemic of t2dm has contributed to cvd becoming the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the united states objective: to review the pathophysiology of cvd; to demonstrate the interrelatedness of cvd the metabolic syndrome and t2dm; and to discuss treatment options that may reduce the risk of cvd in patients with t2dm summary: recent data from the international diabetes federation show that the worldwide prevalence of t2dm is much higher than previously estimated managing patients with t2dm continues to severely burden the us health care system furthermore most costs associated with managing these patients are associated with treating cvd complications studies have shown that several agents can decrease the risk of cvd in patients with t2dm conclusions: to combat the diabetes epidemic clinicians should treat patients with t2dm and prediabetes early and aggressively to control their metabolic disturbances and reduce the risk of cvd diet exercise and several pharmacologic agents have been shown to reduce the risk of cvdthe script concordance (sc) test is an assessment tool designed to probe whether knowledge of examinees is efficiently organized for clinical actions the aim of this study was to develop an sc test and determine whether it could be used to differentiate novices from expert pharmacists in their ability to carry out clinical actions in the area of diabetes mellitus the sc test was developed and validated according to guidelines proposed previously data analysis was performed using a post-hoc test and anova the test developed had 31 items participants included 54 students six new graduates and 16 clinical pharmacists average scores and standard deviations for students new graduates and clinical pharmacists were 1854 (290) 2027(142) and 2109(289) respectively the group differences were significant (p < 005) it is concluded that the sc test could accurately differentiate examinees according to levels of experience it could be a useful tool to measure students' progress in the area of diabetes mellitus\",\n",

lower proportions (581% vs 461%) provided fecal samples while risk factor prevalences were unique as compared to women in other countries (eg less education higher parity) cancer risk factors resembled patterns identified elsewhere (elevated risks associated with higher levels of education familial histories of breast cancer low parity and larger body sizes) subjects with benign conditions were younger and exhibited higher socioeconomic profiles (eg higher education and lower parity) than those with malignancies suggesting selective referral influences while further defining breast cancer risk factors in africa this study showed that successful population-based interdisciplinary studies of cancer in africa are possible but require close attention to diagnostic referral biases and standardized and documented approaches for high-quality data collection including biospecimensbackground late diagnoses and poor prognoses of breast cancer are common throughout africa methods to identify responsible factors we utilized data from a population-based caseäóñcontrol study involving 1184 women with breast malignancies conducted in three hospitals in accra and kumasi ghana interviews focused on potential breast cancer risk factors as well as factors that might contribute to presentation delays we calculated odds ratios (or) and 95% confidence intervals (ci) comparing malignances with biopsy masses larger than 5 cm (624% of the 1027 cases with measurable lesions) to smaller lesions results in multivariate analyses strong predictors of larger masses were limited education (or 196 95% ci 132äóñ290 <primary vs ä\\x8a«senior secondary school) being separated/divorced or widowed (175 118äóñ260 and 225 143äóñ355 respectively vs currently married) delay in care seeking after onset of symptoms (264 177äóñ395 for ä\\x8a«12 vs ä\\x8a_2 months) care having initially been sought from someone other than a doctor/nurse (186 085äóñ409) and frequent use of herbal medications/treatment (151 095äóñ243 for ä\\x8a«3x/day usage vs none) particularly high risks associated with these factors were found among less educated women; for example women with less than junior secondary schooling who delayed seeking care for breast symptoms for 6 months or longer were at nearly 4-times the risk of more educated women who promptly sought assistance conclusions our findings suggest that additional communication particularly among less educated women could promote earlier breast cancer diagnoses involvement of individuals other than medical practitioners including traditional healers may be helpful in this processbackground in case-control studies population controls can help ensure generalizability;

       " (\"background measurement of changes in health across locations is useful to compare and contrast changing epidemiological patterns against health system performance and identify specific needs for resource allocation in research policy development and programme decision making using the global burden of diseases injuries and risk factors study 2016 we drew from two widely used summary measures to monitor such changes in population health: disability-adjusted life-years (dalys) and healthy life expectancy (hale) we used these measures to track trends and benchmark progress compared with expected trends on the basis of the socio-demographic index (sdi) methods we used results from the global burden of diseases injuries and risk factors study 2016 for all-cause mortality cause-specific mortality and non-fatal disease burden to derive hale and dalys by sex for 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2016 we calculated dalys by summing years of life lost and years of life lived with disability for each location age group sex and year we estimated hale using age-specific death rates and years of life lived with disability per capita we explored how dalys and hale differed from expected trends when compared with the sdi: the geometric mean of income per person educational attainment in the population older than age 15 years and total fertility rate findings the highest globally observed hale at birth for both women and men was in singapore at 75\\x8c\\x872 years (95% uncertainty interval 71\\x8c\\x879äóñ78\\x8c\\x876) for females and 72\\x8c\\x870 years (68\\x8c\\x878äóñ75\\x8c\\x871) for males the lowest for females was in the central african republic (45\\x8c\\x876 years [42\\x8c\\x870äóñ49\\x8c\\x875]) and for males was in lesotho (41\\x8c\\x875 years [39\\x8c\\x870äóñ44\\x8c\\x870]) from 1990 to 2016 global hale increased by an average of 6\\x8c\\x8724 years (5\\x8c\\x8797äóñ6\\x8c\\x8748) for both sexes combined global hale increased by 6\\x8c\\x8704 years (5\\x8c\\x8774äóñ6\\x8c\\x8727) for males and 6\\x8c\\x8749 years (6\\x8c\\x8708äóñ6\\x8c\\x8777) for females whereas hale at age 65 years increased by 1\\x8c\\x8778 years (1\\x8c\\x8761äóñ1\\x8c\\x8793) for males and 1\\x8c\\x8796 years (1\\x8c\\x8769äóñ2\\x8c\\x8713) for females total global dalys remained largely unchanged from 1990 to 2016 (äóñ2\\x8c\\x873% [äóñ5\\x8c\\x879 to 0\\x8c\\x879]) with decreases in communicable maternal neonatal and nutritional (cmnn) disease dalys offset by increased dalys due to non-communicable diseases (ncds) the exemplars calculated as the five lowest ratios of observed to expected age-standardised daly rates in 2016 were nicaragua costa rica the maldives peru and israel the leading three causes of dalys globally were ischaemic heart disease cerebrovascular disease and lower respiratory infections comprising 16\\x8c\\x871% of all dalys total dalys and age-standardised daly rates due to most cmnn causes decreased from 1990 to 2016 conversely the total daly burden rose for most ncds; however age-standardised daly rates due to ncds declined globally interpretation at a global level dalys and hale continue to show improvements at the same time we observe that many populations are facing growing functional health loss rising sdi was associated with increases in cumulative years of life lived with disability and decreases in cmnn dalys offset by increased ncd dalys relative compression of morbidity highlights the importance of continued health interventions which has changed in most locations in pace with the gross domestic product per person education and family planning the analysis of dalys and hale and their relationship to sdi represents a robust framework with which to benchmark location-specific health performance country-specific drivers of disease burden particularly for causes with higher-than-expected dalys should inform health policies health system improvement initiatives targeted prevention efforts and development assistance for health including financial and research investments for all countries regardless of their level of sociodemographic development the presence of countries that substantially outperform others suggests the need for increased scrutiny for proven examples of best practices which can help to extend gains whereas the presence of underperforming countries suggests the need for devotion of extra attention to health systems that need more robust supportbackground: in the global burden of disease study 2013 (gbd 2013) knowledge about health and its determinants has been integrated into a comparable framework to inform health policy outputs of this analysis are relevant to current policy questions in england and elsewhere particularly on health inequalities we use gbd 2013 data on mortality and causes of death and disease and injury incidence and prevalence to analyse the burden of disease and injury in england as a whole in english regions and within each english region by deprivation quintile we also assess disease and injury burden in england attributable to potentially preventable risk factors england and the english regions are compared with the remaining constituent countries of the uk and with comparable countries in the european union (eu) and beyond methods: we extracted data from the gbd 2013 to compare mortality causes of death years of life lost (ylls) years lived with a disability (ylds) and disability-adjusted life-years (dalys) in england the uk and 18 other countries (the first 15 eu members [apart from the uk] and australia canada norway and the usa [eu15+]) we extended elements of the analysis to english regions and subregional areas defined by deprivation quintile (deprivation areas) we used data split by the nine english regions (corresponding to the european boundaries of the nomenclature for territorial statistics level 1 [nuts 1] regions) and by quintile groups within each english region according to deprivation thereby making 45 regional deprivation areas deprivation quintiles were defined by area of residence ranked at national level by index of multiple deprivation score 2010 burden due to various risk factors is described for england using new gbd methodology to estimate independent and overlapping attributable risk for five tiers of behavioural metabolic and environmental risk factors we present results for 306 causes and 2337 sequelae and 79 risks or risk clusters findings: between 1990 and 2013 life expectancy from birth in england increased by 5\\x8c\\x874 years (95% uncertainty interval 5\\x8c\\x870-5\\x8c\\x878) from 75\\x8c\\x879 years (75\\x8c\\x879-76\\x8c\\x870) to 81\\x8c\\x873 years (80\\x8c\\x879-81\\x8c\\x877); gains were greater for men than for women rates of age-standardised ylls reduced by 41\\x8c\\x871% (38\\x8c\\x873-43\\x8c\\x876) whereas dalys were reduced by 23\\x8c\\x878% (20\\x8c\\x879-27\\x8c\\x871) and ylds by 1\\x8c\\x874% (0\\x8c\\x871-2\\x8c\\x878) for these measures england ranked better than the uk and the eu15+ means between 1990 and 2013 the range in life expectancy among 45 regional deprivation areas remained 8\\x8c\\x872 years for men and decreased from 7\\x8c\\x872 years in 1990 to 6\\x8c\\x879 years in 2013 for women in 2013 the leading cause of ylls was ischaemic heart disease and the leading cause of dalys was low back and neck pain known risk factors accounted for 39\\x8c\\x876% (37\\x8c\\x877-41\\x8c\\x877) of dalys; leading behavioural risk factors were suboptimal diet (10\\x8c\\x878% [9\\x8c\\x871-12\\x8c\\x877]) and tobacco (10\\x8c\\x877% [9\\x8c\\x874-12\\x8c\\x870]) interpretation: health in england is improving although substantial opportunities exist for further reductions in the burden of preventable disease the gap in mortality rates between men and women has reduced but marked health inequalities between the least deprived and most deprived areas remain declines in mortality have not been matched by similar declines in morbidity resulting in people living longer with diseases health policies must therefore address the causes of ill health as well as those of premature mortality systematic action locally and nationally is needed to reduce risk exposures support healthy behaviours alleviate the severity of chronic disabling disorders and mitigate the effects of socioeconomic deprivationimportance disability secondary to skin conditions is substantial worldwide the global burden of disease study 2013 includes estimates of global morbidity and mortality due to skin diseases objective to measure the burden of skin diseases worldwide data sources for nonfatal estimates data were found by literature search using pubmed and google scholar in english and spanish for years 1980 through 2013 and by accessing administrative data on hospital inpatient and outpatient episodes data for fatal estimates were based on vital registration and verbal autopsy data study selection skin disease data were extracted from more than 4000 sources including systematic reviews surveys population-based disease registries hospital inpatient data outpatient data cohort studies and autopsy data data metrics included incidence prevalence remission duration severity deaths and mortality risk data extraction and synthesis datawere extracted by age time period case definitions and other study characteristics data points were modeled with bayesian meta-regression to generate estimates of morbidity and mortalitymetrics for skin diseases all estimates were made with 95%uncertainty intervals main outcomes and measures disability-adjusted life years (dalys) years lived with disability and years of life lost from 15 skin conditions in 188 countries results skin conditions contributed 179% to the global burden of disease measured in dalys from 306 diseases and injuries in 2013 individual skin diseases varied in size from 038%of total burden for dermatitis (atopic contact and seborrheic dermatitis) 029% for acne vulgaris 019% for psoriasis 019% for urticaria 016%for viral skin diseases 015%for fungal skin diseases 007%for scabies 006%for malignant skin melanoma 005%for pyoderma 004%for cellulitis 003%for keratinocyte carcinoma 003%for decubitus ulcer and 001% for alopecia areata all other skin and subcutaneous diseases composed 012%of total dalys conclusions and relevance skin and subcutaneous diseases were the 18th leading cause of global dalys in global burden of disease 2013 excluding mortality skin diseases were the fourth leading cause of disability worldwideimportance: cancer and other noncommunicable diseases (ncds) are now widely recognized as a threat to global development the latest united nations high-level meeting on ncds reaffirmed this observation and also highlighted the slow progress in meeting the 2011 political declaration on the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases and the third sustainable development goal lack of situational analyses priority setting and budgeting have been identified as major obstacles in achieving these goals all of these have in common that they require information on the local cancer epidemiology the global burden of disease (gbd) study is uniquely poised to provide these crucial data objective: to describe cancer burden for 29 cancer groups in 195 countries from 1990 through 2017 to provide data needed for cancer control planning evidence review: we used the gbd study estimation methods to describe cancer incidence mortality years lived with disability years of life lost and disability-adjusted life-years (dalys) results are presented at the national level as well as by socio-demographic index (sdi) a composite indicator of income educational attainment and total fertility rate we also analyzed the influence of the epidemiological vs the demographic transition on cancer incidence findings: in 2017 there were 245 million incident cancer cases worldwide (168 million without nonmelanoma skin cancer [nmsc]) and 96 million cancer deaths the majority of cancer dalys came from years of life lost (97%) and only 3% came from years lived with disability the odds of developing cancer were the lowest in the low sdi quintile (1 in 7) and the highest in the high sdi quintile (1 in 2) for both sexes in 2017 the most common incident cancers in men were nmsc (43 million incident cases); tracheal bronchus and lung (tbl) cancer (15 million incident cases); and prostate cancer (13 million incident cases) the most common causes of cancer deaths and dalys for men were tbl cancer (13 million deaths and 284 million dalys) liver cancer (572000 deaths and 152 million dalys) and stomach cancer (542000 deaths and 122 million dalys) for women in 2017 the most common incident cancers were nmsc (33 million incident cases) breast cancer (19 million incident cases) and colorectal cancer (819000 incident cases) the leading causes of cancer deaths and dalys for women were breast cancer (601000 deaths and 174 million dalys) tbl cancer (596000 deaths and 126 million dalys) and colorectal cancer (414000 deaths and 83 million dalys) conclusions and relevance: the national epidemiological profiles of cancer burden in the gbd study show large heterogeneities which are a reflection of different exposures to risk factors economic settings lifestyles and access to care and screening the gbd study can be used by policy makers and other stakeholders to develop and improve national and local cancer control in order to achieve the global targets and improve equity in cancer carebackground: superficial fungal infections (sfi) one of the most prevalent diseases in the world are infections of keratin-rich structures of human body mostly caused by dermatophytes and yeasts objectives: the goal of this study was to determine the possible changes in the epidemiology of sfi on the territory of southeastern serbia and to investigate epidemiological characteristics and the influence of sfi on the patient's quality of life methods: from 2012 to the end of 2017 samples of 1643 patients (568 males and 1075 females mean age 4032 \\x8c± 2244 years) with suspected sfi from southeastern serbia were examined using the standard mycological methods the questionnaires were used to investigate epidemiological characteristics results: superficial fungal infections were diagnosed in 205% (n = 336) of patients in the group of dermatophytes the most prevalent was microsporum canis (639% n = 76) followed by trichophyton mentagrophytes (218% n = 26) non-albicans candida species were dominant aetiological agents of superficial candidosis (623%) bmi ä\\x8a«25 kg/m 2 (p = 0019) was determined as an independent risk factor for sfi there was a statistically significant difference in the eqvas score between the groups of patients and the control group (p < 0001) conclusions: results of conducted study indicate that sfi prevalence has not changed in the previous period however increase of candida-sfi prevalence especially candida onychomycosis was establishedimportance: the increasing burden due to cancer and other noncommunicable diseases poses a threat to human development which has resulted in global political commitments reflected in the sustainable development goals as well as the world health organization (who) global action plan on non-communicable diseases to determine if these commitments have resulted in improved cancer control quantitative assessments of the cancer burden are required objective: to assess the burden for 29 cancer groups over time to provide a framework for policy discussion resource allocation and research focus evidence review: cancer incidence mortality years lived with disability years of life lost and disability-adjusted life-years (dalys) were evaluated for 195 countries and territories by age and sex using the global burden of disease study estimation methods levels and trends were analyzed over time as well as by the sociodemographic index (sdi) changes in incident cases were categorized by changes due to epidemiological vs demographic transition findings: in 2016 there were 172 million cancer cases worldwide and 89 million deaths cancer cases increased by 28% between 2006 and 2016 the smallest increase was seen in high sdi countries globally population aging contributed 17%; population growth 12%; and changes in age-specific rates -1% to this change the most common incident cancer globally for men was prostate cancer (14 million cases) the leading cause of cancer deaths and dalys was tracheal bronchus and lung cancer (12 million deaths and 254 million dalys) for women the most common incident cancer and the leading cause of cancer deaths and dalys was breast cancer (17 million incident cases 535äó¿000 deaths and 149 million dalys) in 2016 cancer caused 2132 million dalys globally for both sexes combined between 2006 and 2016 the average annual age-standardized incidence rates for all cancers combined increased in 130 of 195 countries or territories and the average annual age-standardized death rates decreased within that timeframe in 143 of 195 countries or territories conclusions and relevance: large disparities exist between countries in cancer incidence deaths and associated disability scaling up cancer prevention and ensuring universal access to cancer care are required for health equity and to fulfill the global commitments for noncommunicable disease and cancer control\",\n",

now extensive in all continents including north america and europe these maps will help define the spatial limits of current autochthonous transmission of dengue and chikungunya viruses it is only with this kind of rigorous entomological baseline that we can hope to project future health impacts of these virusesbackground in sub-saharan africa women are most likely to receive skilled and adequate childbirth care in hospital settings yet the use of hospital for childbirth is low and inequitable the poorest and those living furthest away from a hospital are most affected but the relative contribution of poverty and travel time is convoluted since hospitals are often located in wealthier urban places and are scarcer in poorer remote area this study aims to partition the variability in hospital-based childbirth by poverty and travel time in four sub-saharan african countries methods we used data from the most recent demographic and health survey in kenya malawi nigeria and tanzania for each country geographic coordinates of survey clusters the master list of hospital locations and a high-resolution map of land surface friction were used to estimate travel time from each dhs cluster to the nearest hospital with a shortest-path algorithm we quantified and compared the predicted probabilities of hospital-based childbirth resulting from one standard deviation (sd) change around the mean for different model predictors results the mean travel time to the nearest hospital in minutes was 27 (kenya) 31 (malawi) 25 (nigeria) and 62 (tanzania) in kenya a change of 1sd in wealth led to a 332 percentage points change in the probability of hospital birth whereas a 1sd change in travel time led to a change of 166 percentage points the marginal effect of 1sd change in wealth was weaker than that of travel time in malawi (131 vs 340 percentage points) and tanzania (204 vs 337 percentage points) in nigeria the two were similar (223 vs 248 percentage points) but their additive effect was twice stronger (446 percentage points) than the separate effects random effects from survey clusters also explained substantial variability in hospital-based childbirth in all countries indicating other unobserved local factors at play conclusions both poverty and long travel time are important determinants of hospital birth although they vary in the extent to which they influence whether women give birth in a hospital within and across countries this suggests that different strategies are needed to effectively enable poor women and women living in remote areas to gain access to skilled and adequate care for childbirthdengue is an emerging viral disease principally transmitted by the aedes (stegomyia) aegypti mosquito it is one of the fastest-growing global infectious diseases with 100äóñ400 million new infections a year and is now entrenched in a growing number of tropical megacities behind this rapid rise is the simple adaptation of ae aegypti to a new entomological niche carved out by human habitation this review describes the expansion of dengue and explores how key changes in the ecology of ae aegypti allowed it to become a successful invasive species and highly efficient disease vector we argue that characterizing geographic heterogeneity in mosquito bionomics will be a key research priority that will enable us to better understand future dengue risk and design control strategies to reverse its global spreadbackground podoconiosis is a type of elephantiasis characterised by swelling of the lower legs it is often confused with other causes of tropical lymphedema and its global distribution is uncertain here we synthesise the available information on the presence of podoconiosis to produce evidence consensus maps of its global geographical distribution methods and findings we systematically searched available data on podoconiosis in scopus and medline from inception updated to 10 may 2019 and identified observational and population-based studies reporting podoconiosis to establish existence of podoconiosis we used the number of cases reported in studies and prevalence data with geographical locations we then developed an index to assess evidence quality and reliability assigning each country an evidence consensus score using these summary scores we then developed a contemporary global map of national-level podoconiosis status there is evidence of podoconiosis in 17 countries (12 in africa three in latin america and two in asia) and consensus on presence in six countries (all in africa) we have identified countries where surveillance is required to further define the presence or absence of podoconiosis we have highlighted areas where evidence is currently insufficient or conflicting and from which more evidence is needed conclusion the global distribution of podoconiosis is not clearly known; the disease extent and limits provided here inform the best contemporary map of the distribution of podoconiosis globally from available data these results help identify surveillance needs direct future mapping activities and inform prevention plans and burden estimation of podoconiosis',\n",

quality of the ab response remain unclear here we investigated the cd4+ t cell response to primary intravenous and intravaginal infection with zikv using the lysmcre+ifnar1fl/fl (myeloid type i ifn receptor-deficient) c57bl/6 mouse models we identified six i-ab-restricted zikv epitopes that stimulated cd4+ t cells with a predominantly cytotoxic th1 phenotype in mice primed with zikv intravenous and intravaginal infection with zikv effectively induced follicular helper and regulatory cd4+ t cells treatment of mice with a cd4+ t cell-depleting ab reduced the plasma cell germinal center b cell and igg responses to zikv without affecting the cd8+ t cell response cd4+ t cells were required to protect mice from a lethal dose of zikv after infection intravaginally but not intravenously however adoptive transfer and peptide immunization experiments showed a role for memory cd4+ t cells in zikv clearance in mice challenged intravenously these results demonstrate that cd4+ t cells are required mainly for the generation of a zikv-specific humoral response but not for an efficient cd8+ t cell response thus cd4+ t cells could be important mediators of protection against zikv depending on the infection or vaccination contextzika virus (zikv) targets neural progenitor cells in the brain attenuates cell proliferation and leads to cell death here we describe a role for the zikv protease ns2b-ns3 heterodimer in mediating neurotoxicity through cleavage of a host protein required for neurogenesis similar to zikv infection ns2b-ns3 expression led to cytokinesis defects and cell death in a protease activity-dependent fashion among binding partners ns2b-ns3 cleaved septin-2 a cytoskeletal factor involved in cytokinesis cleavage of septin-2 occurred at residue 306 and forced expression of a non-cleavable septin-2 restored cytokinesis suggesting a direct mechanism of zikv-induced neural toxicity video abstract: mechanisms by which zika virus leads to microcephaly are poorly understood here li et al demonstrate the zika protease required for viral replication associates with host proteins and cleaves septin-2 a protein required for neural cell divisionclinical reports of zika virus (zikv) rna detection in breast milk have been described but evidence conflicts as to whether this rna represents infectious virus we infected post-parturient ag129 murine dams deficient in type i and ii interferon receptors with zikv zikv rna was detected in pup stomach milk clots (smc) as early as 1 day post maternal infection (dpi) and persisted as late as 7 dpi in mammary tissues zikv replication was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry in multiple cell types including cells morphologically consistent with myoepithelial cells no mastitis was seen histopathologically in the smc and tissues of the nursing pups no infectious virus was detected via focus forming assay however serial passages of fresh milk supernatant yielded infectious virus and immunohistochemistry showed zikv replication protein associated with degraded cells in smc these results suggest that breast milk may contain infectious zikv however breast milk transmission (bmt) does not occur in this mouse strain that is highly sensitive to zikv infection these results suggest a low risk for breast milk transmission of zikv and provide a platform for investigating zikv entry into milk and mechanisms which may prevent or permit bmtzika virus (zikv) is an emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus that represents a major threat to global health zikv infections in adults are generally asymptomatic or present with mild symptoms however recent outbreaks of zikv have revealed that it can cause congenital zika syndrome in neonates and guillain-barrí© syndrome in adults currently no zikv-specific vaccines or antiviral treatments are available in this study we tested the efficacy of convalescent plasma igg hyperimmune product (zikv-ig) isolated from individuals with high neutralizing anti-zikv titers as a therapeutic candidate against zikv infection using a model of zikv infection in ifnar1ä\\x9aí/ä\\x9aí mice zikv-ig successfully protected mice from lethal zikv challenge in particular zikv-ig treatment at 24 hours after lethal zikv infection improved survival by reducing weight loss and tissue viral burden and improving clinical score additionally zikv-ig eliminated zikv-induced tissue damage and inflammation in the brain and liver these results indicate that zikv-ig is efficacious against zikv suggesting this human polyclonal antibody is a viable candidate for further development as a treatment against human zikv infectionzika and the four serotypes of dengue are closely related flaviviruses that share a high degree of structural and sequence homology and co-circulate in many regions of the world here we review recent studies investigating antigenic cross-reactivity between the two viruses we discuss the pathogenic and protective roles of cross-reactive anti-viral antibody and t cell responses respectively in modulating the outcome of secondary dengue or zika infection based on recent findings and increased incidence of severe disease in seronegative recipients of the first dengue vaccine to be licensed we propose that the time has come to focus on developing pan-flavivirus vaccines that protect against zika and four dengue serotypes by eliciting protective cross-reactive t cell responses while concomitantly reducing production of cross-reactive antibodies that can exacerbate diseasedengue virus (denv) is a member of the flavivirus family that includes zika virus (zikv) west nile virus japanese encephalitis virus and yellow fever virus as the most prevalent of the flaviviruses denv is responsible for tens of millions of infections each year the clinical manifestations of infection with one of the four denv serotypes (denv1äóñ4) range from no symptoms to hemorrhagic fever and shock (äóìsevere dengueäó\\x9d) which is fatal in ä\\x9a_25000 patients annually many factors contribute to the development of severe dengue including the denv serotype and host expression of certain hla alleles; however it now seems clear that pre-existing immunity to denväóîand possibly other flavivirusesäóîis a major precipitating factor while primary infection with one denv serotype elicits strong cellular and humoral immune responses that likely confer long-lived protection against the same serotype subsequent infection with a different serotype carries an increased risk of developing severe dengue thus primary denv infection elicits cross-reactive immunity that may be protective or pathogenic depending on the context of the subsequent infection many flaviviruses share high sequence homology raising the possibility that cross-reactive immunity to one virus may contribute to protection against or pathogenesis of a second virus in a similar manner in addition several flaviviruses are now endemic in overlapping geographic regions underscoring the need to gain more knowledge about the mechanisms underlying cross-reactive immunity to different denv serotypes and flaviviruses here we review our current understanding of t cell immunity to denv focusing on cross-reactivity with other serotypes and flaviviruses such as zikv and the role of denv-elicited cd4+ and cd8+ t cells in protection recent work in this area supports a beneficial role for cross-reactive t cells and provides new insights into the design of safe and efficient flavivirus/pan-flavivirus vaccines',\n",
